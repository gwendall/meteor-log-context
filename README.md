Meteor Log Context
==================

Just drop the ``{{> logContext}}`` template anywhere. It will render a button. Click on it. It will log its data context, along with its parents'. Simple as that. But life-saving for debugging.

Installation  
------------

``` sh
meteor add gwendall:log-context
```
